# GUC-Grades

## Motivation
The main goal of this script is to apply what I learned in Python, learn more to achieve the script and finally to automate daily boring stuff which is checking new grades posted on GUC Admin system

## Script Description
It is a simple script based on web scraping idea to save your time while checking your grades

### Features
1. You don't need to log in every time to check your grades you can enable remember me feature
2. After loading your grades you can browse them very fast
3. **MY FAVORITE ONE** You don't need anymore to check all courses and midterm grades to know if there are any updates *As* if there are any updates in your grades a new option in navigation menu will be available then to check new updates in grades only

4. **ANOTHER AWESOME ONE** There are offline mode to check your grades from your last session if you are offline or GUC servers are down
5. If any error occurred when connecting to GUC server or fetching your grades the script won't crash, you will be able to try again without closing the script or go to the offline mode or exit
